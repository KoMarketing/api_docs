### Properties
_Pass an array of flag objects as the value to a 'data' property (see example)._

One or more of the following properties are required to create a flag:

|                |             |             |
| -------------: | :---------: | ----------- |
| **user_id**<br/>required | _Int_ | User id that this flag will be recorded against. |
| **type**<br/>required | _String_ | The type of this flag object. Example types could be 'left_geofence', 'early_clockin', 'geofence_exception', etc. |
| **active**<br/>required | _Boolean_ | true or false. |
| **linked_objects**<br/>read-write | _Object_ | A key/value map of all the objects linked to this flag and the corresponding object ids. |

For a full list of properties that may be set on a flag, see [the Flag object](#the-flag-object).

### Status Codes

Each flag that is created will come back with a `_status_code` and `_status_message` that will indicate whether the flag was created successfully. If there was a problem creating a flag, there may also be an additional field, `_status_extra`, which will contain more details about the failure.

|         |          |
| :-----: | :------- |
| <code class="level200">200</code> | OK. Flag was created successfully. |
| <code class="level400">417</code> | Expectation Failed. Something was wrong or missing with the properties supplied for this flag. See the `_status_extra` value for more detail. |

<aside class="notice">
The maximum batch size is <i>50</i> flags. If exceeded, a <code class="standout">413: Request entity too large</code> HTTP response will be returned.
